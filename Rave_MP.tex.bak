\section{Introduction}
Age determination of metal-poor halo stars not only give us an hint about when star formation began, but is also crucial in pinpointing the chemical enrichment time-scale in the Galactic halo \citep{Cayrel2001}. It is also believed that the detailed abundance pattern of metal poor stars can help determining the nature of the first stellar generations responsible for the first steps of the chemical evolution of our Galaxy (\citealp{Frebel2015,Chiappini2013}). At present, the only information missing deepen our understanding of metal poor stars,  is stellar age, that is affected by systematics or low precision.

Ages can be estimated only for a limited sample of field stars, and then only by using either model-dependent techniques or empirical methods that still need careful calibration. Low-mass metal-poor field giants can be among the oldest objects in our Galaxy, but their age determination via the classic isochrone-fitting method has always been hampered by the high degeneracy that affect the red-giant locus. This degeneration can lead to age uncertainties up to 80\%. The few metal-poor halo field star which age has been determined with high precision, 7 at the writing of this paper, have an age greater than 10 Gyr, derived using the Th-232 U-238 ratio (\Marica{citare i papers per questi oggetti}). This confirms the paradigm that metal-poor Halo object are among the oldest objects in our Galaxy.  

Asteroseismology of solar-like pulsators in recent years demonstred to be able to provide precise masses for giant stars (\citealp{Davies2015, Lebreton2014, Miglio2013, SilvaAguirre2015, Anders2016}), although more tests are urgently needed in the low metallicity regime \citep{Epstein2014}. Solar-like oscillations are commonly summarized by two parameters: $\Delta\nu$ (average frequency separation) and $\nu_{\rm max}$ (frequency of maximum oscillation power). These two quantities can provide precise mass (precision of about 3\%) and radius (precision of about 10\%), from the so-called seismic scaling relations, upon additional information on stellar temperature (T$_{\rm eff}$).  Since for red giants, the mass is a good indicator of the age, it is therefore possible to determine the age of a red giant with a precision better than 30\% \citep{Davies2016}. 

At present, only \citet{Epstein2014} studied a sample of metal-poor halo stars with both seismic information and chemistry from high-resolution APOGEE spectra. Surprisingly, for the most metal-poor stars the authors estimated masses larger than what would be expected for a typical old population. This discrepancy can be explained by taking into account the corrections proposed by \citet{Miglio2016}. By analysing a group of red giants of the globular cluster M4 (\FeH = -1.50 dex), \citet{Miglio2016} suggested that in the metal poor regime seismic masses and radii are reliable, as long as a small correction to the \deltanu scaling relation is applied for RGB stars. This correction is reflected into a slightly decrease of the mass. 

With this letter, we present a set of 4 stars, identified as metal poor (-3$\leq$\FeH$\leq$-2.0 dex)in the RAVE survey and seismic parameters derived from K2 light curve. This letter is organized as follows: in Sec.~\ref{Sect:data} we describe how the stars have been selected. In Sec.~\ref{Sect:massage} we derive masses and ages for our stars. In this section we also face the offsets and uncertainties introduced by wrong assumptions in temperature, element abundances and mass loss. In this same seciton we recompute masses of the \citep{Epstein2014} sample. In Sec.~\ref{Sect:conclusions} we summarize our results.

\section{Spectroscopic and seismic data}
\label{Sect:data}
The Campaign 1 field, centred at RA 11 h 35 m 46 s DEC $+$01$^\circ$ 25' 00'' (l=265, b=$+$58) was observed from 30 May 2014 to 21 August 2014 ; the Campaign 3 field, centred at RA 22 h 26 m 40 s DEC $-$11$^\circ$ 25' 02'' (l=51, b=$-$52) was observed from 14 November 2014 to 03 February 2015. RAVE targets analysed in this work were observed as part of the \textquotedblleft  The K2 Galactic Archaeology Program Campaign\textquotedblright  (C1-C3 proposal GO1059, Stello et al. (2015)). 

In C1 and C3 K2 fields there are a total of 376 RAVE targets for which solar like oscillations have been detected. Following the joined spectroscopic and seismic analysis described in \citet{Valentini2017} and using the technique adopted by \citep{Matijevic2016}, we identified five stars possessing metallicity \FeH$\leq$-1.0 dex. The RAVE spectra of the metal poor stars are visible in Fig.~\ref{Fig:spectra}. In Table~\ref{Tab:stars} the RAVE atmospheric parameters and  abundances are listed. In Fig.~\ref{Fig:datalit} the atmospheric parameters in this work are compared with the values in literature (available for one star) and two different RAVE catalogue: DR5 (\citet{Kunder2017}, pure spectroscopic pipeline) and RAVE-on (\citet{Casey2016}, parameters obtained using a data-driven pipeline).It is worth to notice that the RAVE-on catalogue misplaced these red giants in metallicity or classified them as dwarfs. This misclassification might be due to the training sample adopted in \citet{Casey2017}, consisting mostly in APOGEE red giants.

\label{Fig:seismopipelines}%
\end{figure*}
%--------------------------------------------------
Light curves were obtained using the same approach described in \cite{Valentini2017}. In order to take into account the uncertainties in the seismic parameters, we considered the \deltanu and \numax measured by 4 different pipelines, identified as the initial of their first author \Marica{need some help here, 1 short sentence per method}:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf BM} It is the same method used for CoRoT and \kepler stars\citealp{Mosser2009, Mosser2011}. First the average frequency separation, \dnu , is measured from the autocorrelation of the time series computed as the Fourier spectrum of the filtered Fourier spectrum of the signal. The significance of the \Dnu is then checked using a statistial test based on the H0 hypothesis. If the \Dnu is reliable, then the other seismic parameters are measured with a technique that uses the expected frequency pattern of a Red Giant for identifying oscillations modes. 
\item {\bf GD} This pipeline is based on fitting a background model to the data \citep{Davies2016}. The model is a  model H \citep{Kallinger2014}, comprised of two Harvey profiles, a Gaussian oscillation envelope, and an instrumental noise background. For the estimate of \Numax the central frequency of the Gaussian component is considered. The median and the standard deviation are used to summarize the normal-like posterior probability density for \numax. To estimate the average frequency separation, the same method of BM have been used.
\item {\bf YE} This is a three stages approach \cite{Elsworth2017}. First, a signal-to-noise ratio spectrum (SNR) in function of frequency is created by dividing the power spectrum by a heavily smoothed version of the raw power spectrum. The second step consists in using a combination of H0 and H1 hypothesis for decting oscillation power in segments of the SNR spectrum. If a segment shows detection of oscillations power, then \Numax and \Dnu are detected as a third step\cite{Hekker2010}. This pipeline provided \Dnu with an uncertainty larger that the one provided by other pipelines.
\item {\bf SM} A first esimate of \Dnu was done using the same method as BM. \numax is measured by fitting a Gaussian on top of the background to the power spectrum. Then \Dnu is recomputed from the power spectrum of the power spectrum and by considering only the central orders of the spectrum centered on the highest radial mode \citealp{Mathur2010, Mathur2011}. Differently from the previous pipelines, this one measured a value for \Dnu only for 2 of the 4 targets and provided significantly larger errorbars for \numax.
\end{itemize}

In our analysis we adopter the values of BM, considering their internal error plus an external error, computed as the dispersion between the four pipelines. \Marica{Some seismo expert here: a sentence explaining WHY we chose BM is needed.} The adopted values are listed in Table~\ref{Tab:seism} and visible in Fig.~\ref{Fig:seismopipelines}. We compared the \deltanu and \numax of our sample with the  \deltanu and \numax distribution of APOGEE-{\it Kepler} targets (cita), as visible in Fig.~\ref{Fig:dataseismo}. Using {\it Kepler} stars as reference, our stars fall in the area of the distribution where the less massive stars are located.

We analysed spectra using the GAUFRE pipeline for retrieving \teff , \logg , and \FeH iteratively using the seismic information on \logg , adopting the seismic values listed in Table~\ref{Tab:seism}. Abundances of different chemical elements wete derived using MOOG 2017 \footnote{\url{http://www.as.utexas.edu/\%7Echris/moog.html}}, in the updated version treating Raylegh scattering properly (\cite{Sobeck2011} version available in github \footnote{Github link: \url{https://github.com/alexji/moog17scat}}). 

The linelinst was constructed using linelist presented by Roederer et al 2014, XXX et al 2017 and VALD DR4 (cite). In the following paragraph we will discuss the choice of line parameters and NLTE and 3D effects.

3D effects blabla. Not discussed here.

\textit{Carbon}. C abundance was derived via fitting the A-X CH bandhead at $\sim$4000-4300 \AA. Line parameters from XXX. 

\textit{Nitrogen}. From CN band.

\textit{Oxygen}. Where detectable.

\textit{Alpha-elements}. From ESO spectra we measured the abundances of Mg, Si, Ca and Ti. From the lines. NLTE corrections for Ti are taken from the work of \cite{NLTETi}.

\textit{Iron peak}. We measured abundances of Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn , and Ga. For Fe we adopted the line-by-line NLTE corrections provided by \cite{NLTEFe}. NLTE corrections for Mn are taken from \cite{NLTEMn}. Line-by-line corrections for Fe and Mn are taken from an user-friendly inteface available online \footnote{Available at the website \url{http://nlte.mpia.de/}}.

\textit{n-capt elements}. We were able to measure the element abundances of r- and s- process elements. As indicator of r-process enrichment we measured abundances of Eu, Gd, Tb, and Dy. As s-process markers we measured Sr, Ba and Ce.  

Final abundances and atmospheric parameters are listed in Table~\ref{Tab:stars}. The adopted linelist and the EW of every line used are listed in the Appendix (or online material?).

Mass determination have been per formed using two different methods: a direct method, using scaling relations, and via Bayesian fitting  using the PARAM code. 

%Paragrafo PARAM 
For deriving ages and masses of our stars we adopted the latest version of the PARAM code \citep{2017MNRAS.467.1433R}. The new version of the code uses \dnu and \numax that have been computed along the evolutionary tracks (the previous version was using the frequencies inferred using scaling relations). Respect to the version described in \citep{2017MNRAS.467.1433R}, we extended the grid towards the metal poor end, up to [Fe/H]=-3 dex, by calculating evolutionary tracks for \FeH = -2.0 and -3.0 dex, assuming the He enrichment formula as described in \citet{2017MNRAS.467.1433R}. We also took into account mass loss and $\alpha$-elements enrichment.

The values of stellar mass and radius, derived using scaling relations and PARAM, are shown in Tab.~\ref{Tab:seismres}. The error on the mass and radius derived using the direct method is calculated using propagation of uncertainties (under the assumption of uncorrelated variables). The mass and ages of PARAM are derived using a mass loss value of $\eta$=0.2: we adopted this value since it is in agreement to what measured in \cite{Miglio2012} by comparing the asteroseismic masses of Red Clump stars and Red Giants in the old open clusters NGC6791 and NGC6819. We also adopted an [$\alpha$/Fe]=0.3 dex, a value similar to what measured from RAVE spectra.  The error associated to radius, mass and age derived using PARAM is calculated as the 68 percentile of the PDF. The PDFs of mass and age of the objects of this work are shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:violin}.

\subsection{Uncertainties}

In the age and mass determination we took always into account the uncertainties in the adopted  atmospheric parameters and the uncertainties in the \dnu and \numax determination.

For better understanding the systematics that may affect the age determination using PARAM, different seismic pipelines, and spectroscopic values, we performed several tests under different assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item We determined ages and masses for each set of seismic parameters provided by the 4 different pipelines.
\item  For each set of seismic parameters, we considered 5 different [$\alpha$/Fe] abundances, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 dex. Since the low resolution and the limited wavelength interval of RAVE may affect the measured alpha content of the stars, we wanted to quantify the impact of a miscalculated [$\alpha$/Fe]. 
\item Two different mass loss approximations were considered, $\nu=$0.2 and 0.4. This test has been performed for each set of seismic data adopted.
\item A difference in temperature that may exist between different methods for measuring \Teff, as pointed out by {\bf [cite a paper]}. We determined mass and ages for the selected seismic parameters by varying the \Teff of $\pm$ 100 K. 
\end{itemize}
It is worth to remember that the effects of these tests depend on the position of the star on the HR diagram, and on its evolutionary stage. Each locus of the HR diagram is populated by different tracks and with different levels of degeneracy. 

The variation on $\alpha$ content has no significant effect, providing a mass spread on average of 0.01 Msun and of 0.3 Gyrs in age. As a general behaviour, when the $\alpha$ enrichment increases the mass slightly decreases (and the age increases). 

The underestimation of \Teff lead to a variation in mass and age on average of XX and XX respectively. An overestimation of the same amount leads to a variation of XX in mass and XX in age. When temperature increases the mass increases and the age decreases, the contrary happens when the temperature decreases. This effect is more visible for the most metal poor and hottest stars.

The adoption of a mass loss parameter $\eta$=0.4 leads to a mass and age spread of only XX and XX in mass and age respectively. As discussed in \cite {Anders2016} and \cite{Casagrande2016}, the effect of mass loss is more significant for red clump stars than for RGB stars.

Fig.~\ref{Fig:relative} shows the mass-\FeH and the age-\FeH distributions for every set of calculations we performed. Masses and ages coming from the same calculation had been connected with a line in order to facilitate the reading of the figure (except for the calculations performed using SM seismic parameters, where PARAM converged only for 2 stars). It is visible how the bigger impact on age and mass comes from the seismic parameters, while the [$\alpha$/Fe] and mass loss have a minor effect. The different approaches in seismic parameter pipelines, $\alpha$ content and mass loss do not alter the relative ages of the stars. The mass and ages determined using the seismic values coming from every single pipeline are showed in the Appendix, Fig.~\ref{Fig:agesBenoit},Fig.~\ref{Fig:agesGuy},\ref{Fig:agesSavita} and \ref{Fig:agesYvonne} for the two mass loss assumptions and the 5 different $\alpha$ content. The $\Delta$ \Teff tests using the \dnu and \numax adopted in this work are present in Appendix Fig.~\ref{Fig:Benoitalltests}. 

\section{Distance and orbits} 
Distances were calculated using PARAM and, when available, Gaia parallaxes.

Orbit parameters were calculated uing GALPY (Bovy, citaz. and link). We adopted a Galactic potential, a solar radius of X and soler proper motions from X and Y. Errors on orbit parameters were calculated via Monte-Carlo approach, simulating 1,000 stars per object  with velocity, distance and proper motions variating within errors. Results are summarized in Table~\ref{Tab:orbits}.

\section{Discussion} 

\subsection{201359581}
This star belong to K2 Campaign 1. It is the only star where the temperature derived from the high resolution spectrum is 380 K lower than the \Teff derived from the lower resolution RAVE spectrum and the Teff derived from the IRFM. We already noticed in Valentini et al 2017 that the IRFM tends to over-estimate temperatures at Teff>5000 K. This is probably due to the adoption of RAVE parameters as an imput in the IRFM of Casagrande et al for RAVE. This is then reflected to the measurements of GAUFRE using seismic parameters, since we adopted IRFM temperature as a prior with a flexibility of 200 K. {\bf [Is that too strong as an assumption? The IRFM is known to work well, BUT the IRFM of Casagrande for RAVE used DR5 atmospheric parameters on \logg and \FeH as imput for models.]}

This star has also very low \Dnu and \numax. This gives less confidence in mass and radius, so we recommend to take the age of this star with extreme caution. The star seem to stay above the RGB  bump. 

The star is not C enhanced: [C/Fe]= $+$0.12 dex. The star appears enhanced in Na: [Na/Fe]=$+$2.84 dex. This might be due to unresolved Na interstellar lines, that hampers the abundance measurement. \Marica{A more accurate inspection rejected some Na lines, so I feel more compfortable to lower the log(A)$_{\bf Na}$ to lower values and adopt it as an upper limit.}

\subsection{Comparison with Epstein2014}
We compared the masses of our stars with the masses determined by the only work in literature that determines the masses of metal-poor stars, \cite{Epstein2014}. For the sake of homogeneity, we calculated again the masses of the Epstein sample using PARAM and the values provided in APOGEE-DR14. The recalculation of the masses led to smaller values respect to the original values (see Fig.~\ref{Fig:Epstein}) and our sample, together with the Epstein one, provides a better coverage of the [Fe/H] range $-$2.5-$-$1 dex.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{Sect:conclusions}

We determined mass and ages for a sample of 5 RAVE metal-poor stars. Our analysis took advantage of the seismic informations derived from K2 light curves (Campaigns 1 and 3): asteroseismology was first involved in the spectroscopic analysis and then in the mass and age determination using a Bayesian approach. All the stars but one, possess only intermediate resolution RAVE spectra, while only one target has been observed at higher resolutions. Abundances and atmospheric parameters available in literature for the known star are in agreement with the atmospheric parameters derived form RAVE spectra using the seismic \logg. Abundances and atmospheric parameters are summarized in Tables \ref{Tab:stars} and \ref{Tab:seismres}.

This exploratory work shows that asteroseismology is a powerful tool for determining masses and ages of stars. We derived masses and ages for the 5 RAVE metal poor stars, with a precision of XX\% and XX\% respectively. 

In the mass and age estimation process we thoroughly investigated the impact of different assumptions, and we concluded that:
\begin{itemize}
\item different seismic pipelines: 
\item Shifts in temperature:
\item $\alpha$:
\item Mass loss:
\end{itemize}
We concluded that for metal poor stars in the RGB phase an age determination based on relative ages is a safe approach. 

When available, we strongly suggest to use asteroseismology starting from the spectroscopic analysis, using the seismic \logg in an iterative way, as widely suggested by literature (e.g. Bathala, Morel, Valentini, Valentini). The resulting atmospheric parameters will be more consistent with the seismic parameters that are used for determining ages and masses. 

From our tests it is clear how an intensive study on the chronological chemical enrichment of the Halo is possible only if the sample of stars is analysed n an homogeneous way. At every step of the investigation, from the spectroscopic analysis to the mass and age determination, it is necessary to introduce the same seismic parameters and the same approach for every target. Only this can ensure a precise age and therefore a precise chronological characterization of the sample.

This work pave the path for a more extensive study of metal poor stars with asteroseismology: when combining the precise abundances from spectroscopy with the ages and masses provided by asteroseismology, it is possible to investigate chronologically the chemical enrichment of the Galactic halo. The forthcoming Gaia catalogues and spectra at higher resolution and wider spectral coverage will increase the precision and the number of the chemical abundances.
